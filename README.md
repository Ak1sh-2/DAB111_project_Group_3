# Car Sales Project

## Purpose
This project collects and displays car sales data using Flask and SQLite. The data is served via a simple web application.

## How It Works
1. Data is stored in an SQLite database (`car_sales.db`).
2. A Flask web app serves the data via three pages:
   - Home Page: Add car data.
   - About Page: Data source and variable definitions.
   - Data Page: View stored data.
   
## How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
